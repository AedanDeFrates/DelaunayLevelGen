# DelaunayLevelGen : Aedan DeFrates

# About
This is a level generation project that expands on an earlier attempt to create a dungeon style level generation. In the origional I grouped rooms by four so that, naturally, I would not have to concern myself with overlapping rooms. I expaned on that project by implementing a naive implementation of a Delaunay Search algorithm. This algorithm connects all rooms by edges and creates a Delaunay-safe graph of nodes.
